\conti
\item A farmer was having a field in the form of a
parallelogram PQRS . She took any point A on
RS and joined it to points P and Q. In how
many parts the fields is divided? What are the
shapes of these parts? The farmer wants to sow
wheat and pulses in equal portions of the field
separately. How should she do it?\\

\item \textbf{Solution} :

\begin{itemize}
\item  After joining the point A to p and Q, the feild is divided into 3 parts.\\
\item All the three parts are in triangle shape.\\
As PQRS is a parallelogram so\\
\begin{align*}
\textit{Area of PQRS} = \textit{Area of} \triangleAPS + \triangleARQ + \trianglePAQ --(1)\\
\textit{Area of triangle is half of parallelogram if they have same base and lie between same parallel lines}. \\
\textit{Area of} \trianglePAQ = \frac{1}{2} Area of PQRS\\
\trianglePAQ = \frac{1}{2} area(\triangleAPS + \triangleARQ + \triangle APQ\\
2\trianglePAQ - \trianglePAQ = area(\triangleAPS + \triangleARQ)\\
\trianglePAQ = \triangleAPS + \triangleARQ\\
\textit{Hence the farmer can sow wheat in} \trianglePAQ \textit{and pulses in} \triangleAPS and \triangle ARQ\\
