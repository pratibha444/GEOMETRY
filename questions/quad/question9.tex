\item Can you construct a quadrilateral PQRS with PQ=3, RS=3, PS=7.5, PR=8 and SQ=4?\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Given}:  Quadrilateral PQRS with PQ = 3 cm RS =  3 cm PS = 7.5 cm and SQ = 4 cm\\

We know from triangle inequality theorem that sum of any two sides is greater than the third side ,\\
But here we have PQ = 3 cm PS =  7.5 cm SQ = 4 cm ( AS we get PQS triangle in quadrilateral PQRS where PQ and PS are sides and SQ is diagonal of quadrilateral . \\

And\\

PQ + SQ = 3 + 4 = 7\\

and\\

PS = 7.5 , So\\

PQ + SQ $<$PS ,\\
 But that equation is not true for another triangle.\\
So, we can't construct the given quadrilateral.
